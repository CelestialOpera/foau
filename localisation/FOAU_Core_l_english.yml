 imperial_socialism_desc:0 "Imperial Socialism is a variant of Socialism that can trace its roots back to the United Kingdom. Formed in the melting pot of nations that was Imperial London, in debate salons as well as union pubs, Imperial Socialism is deeply internationalist in its onlook. What sets the ideology apart from the other stems of Socialism is its belief in the "Red Worker's Burden", that it is the task of the emancipated working class to spread the revolution to countries it has yet to reach, and shepherd the unemancipated workers towards the universal Socialist Commonwealth, a fraternity of equal nations under the scarlet banner. Imperial Socialism is revolutionary, but rejects revolutionary terror tactics, believing that the Commonwealth is unattainable without humanity and mutual cooperation. A uniquely British way of thought, Imperial Socialism has very few adherants outside of Great Britain, but has made some traction within the British socialist movement."

 #Pastoralist Subs
 pastoralism_ideology:0 "Pastoralism"

 #Staatist Subs
 revanche_liberalism:0 "Revanche Liberalism"
 revanche_liberalism_desc:0 "Revanche Liberalism is the name of the ideology put in place under the Herriot Regime of France. The term came about prior to the establishment of the Nouvelle démocratie system. Despite its name, Revanche Liberalism is a fairly illiberal staatist ideology that espouses extreme anti-radicalism, autocratic rule, revanche, and colonialism. It is at times compared to Popularism by liberals and sometimes nicknamed Herriotism, and despite its anti-radical talking points is radical in its own right. Followers of the ideology however tend to strongly defend it as being liberal, and socially protectionist, defending their nation against radicalism while ignoring the radical extents the beliefs itself holds onto."
