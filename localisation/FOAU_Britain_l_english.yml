 britain.1.t:0 "Failed Coup Provokes Civil War"
 britain.1.d:0 "Order had barely settled into London as the Royal Army finished off the last holdouts of Royal Marines. As the few prisoners were rounded off, general Bernard Law Montgomery went through the city, surveying the damage. The Royal Navy had really done a number on the city, as Navy ships in the Thames had shelled multiple loyalist positions as the coup had lost momentum in the afternoon. The clock tower of Big Ben had been blown to pieces, the fact it was even still standing was impressive; much of the riverfront was in ruins; and River Thames itself ran black with oil from the ships sunk by Loyalist counter-artillery. Saint Paul's Cathedral and Buckingham Palace had escaped most of the fighting, thank God, but clean-up would take weeks at best. Bernard sighed as he and his entourage of officers passed yet another ruin where relief workers were still busy digging out victims of another bombardment, yet more civilians who paid the ultimate price for the navy's treason. Tires squealed as an army car breaked up on the debris-filled road besides the entourage, a young army private sitting behind the wheel. He sprung a crisp salute at Bernard, who was quick to return it.\n\"General, clean-up in the Palace of Westminster is complete." The private said, his face filled with uncertainty. \"The Prime Minister, he'.s... he's... he's dead, sir. We found him executed in the basement."\n\"Very well, private. Thank you for the report." Bernard responded.\"Sounds like I'll be needed at headquarters shortly."\nBernard saluted his entourage and entered the car, which sped off towards Parliament Square Garden, where the army had established its headquarters. Urban ruin proceeded as far as the eye could see. To see the heart of the Empire in such a state weighed heavily on the general, but shortly they arrived. Bernard exited the car, but before he could even ask for a report, a radio officer ran out of the radio tent.\n\"General, sir! We've intercepted radio broadcasts from Birmingham, Manchester and many other Northern cities. The trade unions have taken over multiple cities!"\nBernard Montgomery rubbed his temples and adjusted his beret. Today was going to be a very long day."

 britain.2.t:0 "Which Side Are You On?"
 britain.2.d:0 "Uncertainty ruled in Bristol. Just across the Channel, in Wales, red flags flew from every rooftop, yet here in Bristol, the Storm Soldiers of the National Purity League had beaten back the disorganized attempts by the local trade unions to seize power, and now an uncomfortable power sharing agreement had arisen between local authorities and the Purity League, ostensibly to keep any 'red saboteurs' down until the 'treacherous subversives' had been defeated, a label everyone knew extended to the Liberal government too. While most were generally appreciative that order had quickly been restored, the parade General Fuller held through the city with his assortment of Royal Army soldiers and NPL Storm Soldiers afterwards hadn't done much to ease the remaining worries. Although calm ostensibly reigned in the streets, as red artillery had yet to hit the town, concerning developments were unfolding in the high schools, factories and docks of the town, as tardies and truancy grew ever more frequent. So did vandalism, the most notable example hereof was when the impromptu headquarters of the NPL-SS had both the Union Jack and the Torch of the WUM drawn upon its walls during the same night. A house that had once stood united was now growing ever more divided, and although the frontlines for now were outside of Bristol, the lines between the citizens had never been clearer than now."
 britain.2.o1:0 "For The WUM!"
 britain.2.o2:0 "For The NPL!"
 britain.2.o3:0 "Hmmm, Maybe Not"
 
 britain.3.t:0 "Civil War in Britain!"
 britain.3.d:0 "The world is shaken as the United Kingdom has violently imploded into civil war. With order rapidly breaking down following the Black Morning on the Thames and then a failed coup carried out by the Royal Navy, the country has splintered. The Midlands has seen a full-scale Trade Union insurrection, with multiple cities falling under Union control, while the right-radical National Purity League has seized control of large portions of the South, ostensibly under the guise of protecting them from 'Red Radicals', leaving the remains of the Liberal government in control of just Scotland and London itself. With the breakdown of order in Britain, the Empire is thrown into disarray, as governors scramble to secure contorl over their territories, as well as leaving a large power vacuum in the rest of the world."
 britain.3.o1:0 "Will the sun finally set on Britain?"
